1. Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The DriverPass project was an assignment given by the client who wished to have a system designed that would allow people to take classes and test, as well a drive for practice, to help them get ready to get their drivers license.

2. What did you do particularly well?

What I think I did well was create the multiple diagrams needed for the DriverPass project, the activity, class, use case, and sequence diagrams.

3. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

When it comes to an area i would choose to revise when it comes to these documents, the technical documents and the systems limitations are the two things I would like to improve. I would want to be more accurate on both, and give more important system limitations.

4. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

When it came to the user's needs, I listened to what the client wanted the user to be able to do with the system and worked to implement thaht for the user. The importance on considering the user's needs is drastic, for they are the ones the system is being made for, so making sure they are able to smoothly user the system is important. 

5. How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

When it came to my approach with designing the software, making sure to take in the clients inputs and then taking that and working to bring what they wanted was important. Some of the techniques i would user in the future to analyze and design a system will be the diagrams, such as the use case diagram, which allows me to point out what the system needs to be cable of with the completed system.
